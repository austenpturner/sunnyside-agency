## My process

### Built with

- React via Vite
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've always been a flexbox gal and do not have much experience with grid. I decided it was time to start learning and that this would be the perfect project for it! I got comfortable with setting up rows and columns, centering and justifying items inside, and setting item columns and row starts/ends. There's so much more to learn and I plan to continue to explore and use grid.

### Continued development

I'd like to clean up my SCSS and make better use of CSS grid.

Make the social media icons change to white on hover.

Add some animations!
